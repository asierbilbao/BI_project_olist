# BI_project_olist
**Asier Bilbao & Valentin Weidinger**

The Olist data set contains 14 tables with information of 100.000 orders from the olist website from 2016 to 2018. The data holds different information like orders, product-informations,
seller-information and much much more. It was anonymized before publishing it on Kaggle. 

The data-sets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist)
